# Assembler-CPU

# Description

This project is the emulation of the work of a processor. The program reads a file with byte code, translate them into commands, and executes them.

# Files

## Decoder.cpp
This is the main file. It conatins functions to translate byte code into commands.

## Stack_Dyn_Func.cpp
This file is taken from the [Stack-Dyn](https://github.com/kostya2709/Stack_Dyn) repository. 
The dynamic stack was used in this project to emulate the work of a real assembler with its own program stack.

# Examples

You can see the examples of the assembly code in the [Assembler_ASM](https://github.com/kostya2709/Assembler_ASM/tree/master/Examples) repository.
